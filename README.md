# Voice Diary
### Your personal Transcriptions App &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   :microphone: ->   :scroll:
This is my app to convert easily all my audio to text.  
(It's clearly very simple, because it has born as a very simple tool to help me not recording long not usable audios)


### Story :seedling:
All started with the diary that I'm continuing writing for 2 years till now.
It is very useful, but there are a lot of times when I would like to record very long audio just to throw out all my thoughts. But as everyone nows, sometimes long audio
are really unfeasible to hear and are also an accessibility barrier. That's why I wanted the possibility to talk and then have an automatic translation in written text.
So I start thinking an app that gives the possibility to talk but producing a text.
And then in some hours the app was already born...

### Configuration  :wrench:
It needs only to be installed and you need to grant the permission to access to your microphone...
...and then the magic starts
