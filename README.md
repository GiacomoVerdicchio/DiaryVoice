# Voice Diary
### Your personal Transcriptions App &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   :microphone: ->   :scroll:
This is my app to convert easily all my audio to text.  
(It's clearly very simple, because it has born as a very simple tool to help me not recording long not usable audios)


### Story :seedling:
All started with the diary that I'm continuing writing for 2 years till now.
It is very useful, but there are a lot of times when I would like to record very long audio just to throw out all my thoughts. But as everyone nows, sometimes long audio
are really unfeasible to hear and are also an accessibility barrier. That's why I wanted the possibility to talk and then have an automatic translation in written text.
So I start thinking an app that gives the possibility to talk but producing a text.
And then in some hours the app was already born...

### Configuration  :wrench:
It needs only to be installed and you need to grant the permission to access to your microphone...
...and then the magic starts 

### Notes
Clearly this app is very simple and the design of the app (from a technical point of view) is not so well-structured, has no Model View Model-View pattern was applied and 
so it has a very centralized-monolithic organization. But this is due to the need of having the app ready as faster as possible, because this tool was truely and desperately needed.

<br></br> So any refactor in order to make the architecture cleaner will be a future upgrade.
